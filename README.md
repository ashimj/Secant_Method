# Secant_Method
In numerical analysis, the secant method is a root-finding algorithm that uses a succession of roots of secant lines to better approximate a root of a function f. The secant method can be thought of as a finite-difference approximation of Newton's method.
The following Matlab Code is prepared according to the algorithm mentioned on the description file as a part of project on MCSC 202.
